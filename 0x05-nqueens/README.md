#### Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this problem:

1. **Backtracking Algorithm**: We'll use a backtracking algorithm to try placing queens one by one in different columns and rows, and backtrack when we find a position that leads to a conflict.
2. **Checking Validity**: For each queen placement, we need to check if it's valid by ensuring no other queen is in the same row, column, or diagonal.
3. **Recursive Solution**: We'll use recursion to try placing queens row by row.


##### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Initialize the Board**: We'll use a list to store the positions of the queens.
2. **Check for Valid Placement**: A function to check if placing a queen at a given row and column is valid.
3. **Recursive Function to Place Queens**: A function to place queens using backtracking.
4. **Main Function**: To read input, handle errors, and call the recursive function.
