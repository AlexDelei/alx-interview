#### Prime Game
Understanding prime numbers, game theory and algorithm optimization to solve a competetive game scenario.
The challenge involves determining the winnner of the game based on strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

##### Concepts required:
1. Prime numbers
- Understanding what prime numbers are.
- Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

2. Sieve of Eratosthenes
- An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers upto a given limit.

3. Game theory
- Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
- Understanding conditions and strategies that lead to a win or a loss.

4. Dynamic programming/Memoization
- Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solutions for multiple rounds of the game.
