#### Creating a 2D Array
Using 2D arrays/lists the right way involves understanding the structure, accessing elements, and efficiently manipulating data in a two-dimensional grid. By mastering the use of 2D arrays, you can significantly improve your ability to handle complex data and efficiently perform various operations.

```
rows, cols = (5, 5)
print([[0 for i in range(cols)] for j in range(rows)])
```
